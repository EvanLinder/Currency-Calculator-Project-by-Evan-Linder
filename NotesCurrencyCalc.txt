Currency website converter

--Design idea--

Ideally, I want my currency converter/calculator to show the user, every single currency
widely known and be able to convert it to usd, immediatly. Also, making it the opposite being 
able to turn usd into any other widely known currency. I am going to try and only use book 
book sources so better teach myself.

--Day 1 - 3/19/2021--

I am going to dive into it, and try and use HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT to create this currency 
calcultor. I am using "HTML/CSS design and build websites" by Jon Duckett to help self-
teach myself.
